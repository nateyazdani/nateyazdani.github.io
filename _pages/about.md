Hello! I am a [PhD student](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/people/nathaniel-yazdani/) at Northeastern University's [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu), in the [Programming Research Laboratory](https://prl.ccs.neu.edu), where I conduct research in _formal methods_ and _programming languages_. Right now, I am on internship with [BedRock Systems](https://www.bedrocksystems.com), applying formal methods to real-world software infrastructure using the [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr) theorem prover and the [Iris](https://iris-project.org) logical framework.

Previously, I was a BS/MS student at the University of Washington's [Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering](https://www.cs.washington.edu), in the [Programming Languages & Software Engineering](https://uwplse.org) research group, where I worked with Ras Bodik, Dan Grossman, John Leo, and Talia Ringer. As an undergraduate, I was honored to receive [research recognition from the CRA](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2016/12/13/uw-cse-undergraduates-recognized-as-outstanding-researchers-by-the-computing-research-association/) and a [Washington Research Foundation Fellowship](https://www.washington.edu/undergradresearch/students/funding/wrff/fellows/2016-17-wrf-fellows/). If you'd like to read more about my undergraduate research experience, an interview is available [here](https://news.cs.washington.edu/2017/02/10/uw-cse-undergrad-nate-yazdanis-love-of-research-plse-es-through-his-veins/).
